Project desciption:
* The business problem is to optimize the revenue and customer satisfaction at Chef's Kitchen restaurant. By analyzing the data on tips and revenue, the restaurant aims to understand which customer segments are more likely to give higher tips and spend more on their dining experience. This information can be used to tailor the restaurant's marketing strategies, customer service training, and menu offerings to maximize revenue and enhance customer satisfaction. Additionally, the analysis can help identify any gaps in service quality or areas where improvements can be made to enhance the overall dining experience and increase customer loyalty.
